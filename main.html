    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I have always been fascinated by technology and the way software can solve real-world problems. The ability to create something meaningful from just lines of code excites me. 
        Becoming a developer allows me to innovate, improve efficiency, and make an impact. I enjoy the challenge of coding and the satisfaction of building applications that people can use. 
        Additionally, the tech industry is constantly evolving, which means there are always new things to learn and explore. This continuous growth motivates me to pursue a career in software development.
